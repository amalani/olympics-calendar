# olympics-calendar

I couldn't find anywhere a calendar that I could sync with my google calendar for sports/teams I'm interested in so I made a script that generates ics files and open-sourced it.

All calendars are available here: https://fabrice404.github.io/olympics-calendar/

They will be automatically updated during the event, so better to use the URL instead of downloading the files.
